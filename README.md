IDSDP_MoST_License
-------------------------------------
This API testing is done on the IDSDP_MoST_License project's license A user application. License A is given to the institutions for using radioactive materials. I performed API testing from the applicant end using Postman and generated a report using Newman

Features that are used in Postman
--------------------------------------
HTTP method and HTTP Response Code

Newman for report generation

Lessons Learned
---------------------------------
API testing was not mandatory for this Application but after the Login authentication was done the API generated a Token, I pasted the token in a Token converter and discovered that it decoded the user's email address and password directly, Which is a security concern. It helped me learn about my API's performance and I could validate why the system was facing some errors and fix them asap.
