Lessons Learned
API testing was not mandatory for this Application but after the Login authentication done that API generated a Token , I pasted the token in a Token converter and discover that it decoded the users email address and password directly, Which is a security concern.It help me learn about my API's performance and I could validate thast why the system was facing some error and fix them asap.
